            My name is Sidney Gil. I graduated from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in May of 2024. 
            I would say I’m most proficient in Java, C++, and Python, and I have worked with tools such as Active Directory, Docker, and Angular. 
            I’ve had hands on experience with at an internship for Walmart where I got to work with databases and create dashboards for endpoint devices so that vendors could see how their devices were being used throughout the company. 
            I most recently got to work with Revature on a project where I am creating a Java program that is able to create and alter Pokémon card deck tables using PostgreSQL. Currently, I am looking for a job where I am able to work in a team and develop even more useful skills that I can put into real world products.
